## Explanation

I began working on this project to create a easy to use interface where customers to Oakleaf Cakes Bake Shop could design and price out custom cakes based on componentized cake sketches.  It performs this function by dynamically calculating and rendering SVG "sketches" based on parameters set by user. The business was sold shortly after the project began, so I never had the opportunity to add a ms-paint style texture/pattern creator functionality I was designing, but even without it, I think this is a pretty cool little app.
